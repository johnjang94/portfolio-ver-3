                  I was a lab assistant for a neuroscience research team in
                  Department of Psychology at University of New Brunswick (which
                  the campus is located in Fredericton, New Brunswick, Canada).
                  Although everything that we were interested in was looking at
                  the data that was measured and generated by computer (but in
                  which the input was made by users), we were basically
                  providing some physical and visual tools to the participants
                  to interact with during the experiments. The entire point of
                  this activity was to see how visuals (or tools) influence the
                  way we make decisions.

                <p>
                  After I graduated in UNB, I had an opportunity to teach
                  English to students in Korea. It was not my expectation, but I
                  also needed to embrace a bit of different teaching conditions
                  due to COVID-19. COVID-19 changed my work environment from
                  in-class to remote-basis to avoid the spread of the virus.
                  Despite the changes in my work conditions, I still needed to
                  find ways to keep my students entertained and engaged in
                  lessons. I started to look for lots of interactive visual
                  resources including the materials that were provided by the
                  academic institution that

                  I was working for. I was constantly contemplating on what kind
                  of visual materials (the product) would keep up with high
                  engagement rate. Basically, I was conducting heavy level of
                  research and was redesigning the presentation to keep the
                  students engaged which were basically the steps for UX Design.
                  In fact, I was gaining my experience in learning design (or
                  educational, experiential design).

            <p>
              Wrapping up my trip in Korea, I have come to realize that I have
              been quite keen on understanding how visuals (i.e. typography,
              color, different shapes of elements, etc.) influence the way we
              interpret and decide on things ever since high school.
            </p>
            <p className="py-3">
              Having said that, I pursued my way into the field of UX and went
              to design school at York University (which is located in North
              York, Ontario, Canada).

        <p>
          It is true that my journey has been up and down even after graduating
          from the design school at York University. Still, I have tried my best
          to participate in many different design projects in which the fields
          are diverse: from social services to blockchain, e-commerce, SaaS
          company or travel agency.

            <p>
              I realized that I needed a portfolio that showcases all my
              previous case studies --- preferably on a website. Though, the
              existing no-code website builders were really limiting my
              creativity on how I want to express myself and my work. Having
              said that, I have decided to learn it myself. Surprisingly, I have
              taught myself well-enough that I was also invited as a volunteer
              apprentice for a few web development projects. Until this day, I
              am still contributing as a web developer apprentice in a few
              projects.
