            In a city with approximately 1.6 million residents, the annual food
            waste problem amounts to about{" "}
            <span className="text-red-500">1.3 billion tons</span>. This issue
            arises due to nearly 1 out of 4 residents are not successful in
            finding the right food they need, resulting in{" "}
            <span className="text-red-500">20% fewer donations</span> over a
            2-week period. To increase awareness in where residents can find or
            donate the food on-demand, I updated the search function to

            food they were looking for more easily.
