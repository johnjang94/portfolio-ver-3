            The design team for The Sakhi had an active discussion on which size
            that we will design first (desktop vs mobile) because we wanted to
            accommodate the user needs in the quickest way.

            The Sakhi were short on hands in the research team, so this was a
            good opportunity for me to pull my sleeves to support the process of
            research and learn different research techniques

          Shopify was a <span className="text-blue-500">new platform</span> to

            I did not explicitly mention in the description, but this platform
            was built using Shopify. Even though I have some level of experience
            in web development, Shopify was a new tool that I was not familiar
            with. I had a good opportunity to learn more of Shopify.
