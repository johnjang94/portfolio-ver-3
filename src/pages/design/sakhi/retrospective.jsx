            The design team for The Sakhi had an active discussion on which size
            that we will design first (desktop vs mobile) because we wanted to
            accommodate the user needs in the quickest way.

            The Sakhi were short on hands in the research team, so this was a

            was built using Shopify. Even though I have some level of experience
            in web development, Shopify was a new tool that I was not familiar
            with. I had a good opportunity to learn more of Shopify.
