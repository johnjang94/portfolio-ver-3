            As a non-Indian, I had only heard a little about India and
            Bollywood, so participating in this project was particularly
            intriguing for me. In the end, it turned into a valuable opportunity
            to learn a great deal about the country. I was especially surprised
            to discover just how many holidays India hasâ€”and that the range of
            clothing associated with each holiday is even more diverse than I
            had ever imagined.

            This project demonstrated that simplifying complex navigation
            through targeted UX research can significantly enhance user
            experience and set the stage for ambitious conversion goals. The
            iterative, data-driven design process not only improved usability
            but also ensured that the brand&#39;s cultural story was effectively
            communicated, reinforcing The Sakhi&#39;s market positioning.
