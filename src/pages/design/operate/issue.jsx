          I conducted the market research using 1:1 interviews with the
          small-medium business owners and managers as well as the
          well-established brands in hotel industry to uncover how they use the
          management platform, what benefits they get from those management
          platforms, and what challenges they face every day despite the
          benefits. I had a chance to discuss on 5 different well-established
          brands with a total of 8 participants (4 from Canada and 4 from the
          United States).
