          Having said that, I have pulled up my sleeves to help the design team
          (specifically focused on) for the inventory dashboard. I have decided
          to cover room availability, room rates, turnover ratio for the rooms,
          stock status for the packaged food and beverage, and showing the
          contacts for partner companies when stocks go low.

          My initial sketch emphasized displaying key metrics, enabling
          hoteliers to quickly track activities. In addition, I considered
          technical aspects to ensure the data visualization method aligned
          seamlessly with the backend architecture and enhanced overall system
          efficiency during this process.
