            Best Lesson 1 | The Subscription Model

            In this project, all the services were offered as a subscription
            basis. As I am not a business-person yet, it was a good opportunity
            to find out what a business model looks like and how it works in
            reality.

          <p className="px-5">
            Earlier, I mentioned that I made some changes in my design during
            mid-fidelity. The reason for the change was that we came to realize
            how complex the service becomes when we combine accommodation of the
            rooms and the catering services. The pivot was a good choice because
            we were able to keeping our own statement that we will keep the
            product easy-to-use. If we decided to combine everything in
            all-in-one solution, I think that we might not have been able to
            have the users clearly understand how things work.
